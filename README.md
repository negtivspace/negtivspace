# J3ffyang's Portfolio

Building **AI-powered automation skills**, **productivity tools**, and **knowledge systems** for individual developers and AI-native workflows.

---

## 🎯 What I Do

I create **production-ready automation skills** across multiple AI platforms (OpenCode, Hermes, OpenClaw, Claude), focusing on:

- **Skill-based AI orchestration** — turning workflows into reusable, composable skills
- **Multilingual content automation** — English ↔ Chinese/Traditional Chinese
- **Developer productivity tools** — Chrome extensions, CLI utilities, API integrations
- **AI platform experimentation** — deeply hands-on with OpenCode, Hermes, OpenClaw, Claude, and OpenRouter

All code prioritizes **clarity over cleverness**: simple, readable, portable, and easy to fork.

## 📦 Main Repositories

### AI Skills (by platform)

**⚡ OpenCode — the growing collection, auto-published to ClawHub**

My OpenCode skills live in `ai-thoughts/.opencode/skills/` and publish to [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/j3ffyang) automatically on every push — no local installs, one owner account. The collection is growing fastest here:

- **`astro-sync`** — convert & polish an article into an AstroPaper post for the astro_journal blog (everbox.io), images included
- **`resize-for-banner`** — 16:9 (LinkedIn) / 5:2 (X) social banners, padded black, never cropped, never overwrites the source
- **`translate-to-chn`** — translate an article into Simplified Chinese as a `-chn.md` twin

## 🔍 Code Highlights

*Automation tooling that keeps this portfolio, its READMEs, and its ClawHub skills in sync.*

### Example: Generate the Portfolio with Python
**Repo:** `ai-thoughts` | **Language:** Python | **Purpose:** Render PORTFOLIO.md from a template + `articles.yaml` + git log

```python
def render(data: dict) -> str:
    out = TEMPLATE.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    values = {
        "ARTICLE_COUNT": str(article_count()),
        "LATEST_ARTICLES": latest_articles(data),
        "LAST_UPDATED": last_updated(),
    }
    for key, value in values.items():
        out = out.replace("{{" + key + "}}", value)
    leftover = sorted(set(re.findall(r"\{\{[A-Z_]+\}\}", out)))
    if leftover:
        print(f"error: unfilled placeholders: {leftover}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    return out
```

**Why it matters:** Turns `articles.yaml` + git log into a fresh PORTFOLIO.md with zero hand-editing, and `--check` mode keeps the committed file honest in CI.

---

### Example: Auto-Wrap Markdown Prose with Python
**Repo:** `ai-thoughts` | **Language:** Python | **Purpose:** Join hard-wrapped paragraphs into single-line paragraphs while preserving code fences, tables, and lists

```python
def glue(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    a_end, b_start = a[-1:], b[:1]
    if CJK.match(a_end) and CJK.match(b_start):
        return ""          # 中文之间不加空格
    return " "
```

**Why it matters:** Article and skill prose is stored one-paragraph-per-line (auto-wrapped); this tool restores that convention across `docs/` and `.opencode/skills/` without touching structure — and `--check` flags any file that drifts.

---

### Example: Auto-Publish Skills to ClawHub with GitHub Actions
**Repo:** `ai-thoughts` | **Language:** YAML + Python | **Purpose:** Publish `.opencode/skills/` to ClawHub on every push — no local CLI

```yaml
name: ClawHub Skill Sync
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - ".opencode/skills/**"
      - ".github/workflows/clawhub-skill-sync.yml"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  publish:
    if: github.event_name != 'pull_request' && github.repository_owner == 'j3ffyang'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7.0.1
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@<sha>
        with:
          bun-version: 1.3.10
      - name: Checkout ClawHub CLI
        uses: actions/checkout@v7.0.1
        with:
          repository: openclaw/clawhub
          ref: v0.23.3
          path: clawhub-source
      - name: Install ClawHub CLI dependencies
        working-directory: clawhub-source
        run: bun install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Publish skills to ClawHub
        env:
          CLAWHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.clawhub_token }}
        run: python3 scripts/clawhub_publish.py
```

**Why it matters:** Publishing runs the ClawHub CLI directly instead of the reusable workflow, so the five real statuses the CLI can return — `unchanged`, `would-publish`, `submitted`, `published`, `pending-publication` — are all treated as success. (The upstream reusable workflow only maps three of them, so a successful async publish showed up as a red ✗.) The `repository_owner` guard still stops the two remotes from double-publishing to one ClawHub account.

---

### Example: Verify a Published Skill with a Shell One-Liner
**Repo:** `publish-skills` skill | **Language:** Shell | **Purpose:** Confirm what's live on ClawHub via the read-only skills API

```bash
# What's actually live? Check latestVersion + owner.handle
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLH_TOKEN" \
  https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills/<slug>
```

**Why it matters:** Turns "the workflow failed" into a verified fact — the API call proves a skill published even when the upstream workflow's status mapping reports a false failure.

---

### Example: Auto-Publish Skills to ClawHub with Python
**Repo:** `ai-thoughts` | **Language:** Python | **Purpose:** Drive the pinned ClawHub CLI to publish every `.opencode/skills/*` folder, treating all five real statuses as success

```python
OK_STATUSES = {"unchanged", "would-publish", "submitted", "published", "pending-publication"}
...
status = json.loads(completed.stdout).get("status")
if status in OK_STATUSES:
    ok.append({"slug": target.name, "status": status})
else:
    failed.append({"slug": target.name, "status": status, "message": f"Unknown publish status: {status}"})
```

**Why it matters:** The upstream reusable workflow only maps three of the five statuses, so a successful async publish (`pending-publication`) surfaced as a red ✗. This treats all five as success and prints an `ok`/`failed` JSON summary the workflow can trust — while the `repository_owner` guard still stops the two remotes from double-publishing to one ClawHub account.

---

### Example: Keep the Profile README's Numbers Honest with Python
**Repo:** `negtivSpace` | **Language:** Python | **Purpose:** Recompute every derived number in the profile README (skills, repos, articles, Quick Links) from the nested repos

```python
def apply(pattern: str, repl: str, desc: str, flags: int = 0) -> None:
    nonlocal text
    new, n = re.subn(pattern, repl, text, flags=flags)
    if n:
        text = new
        edits.append(desc)
    else:
        failures.append(desc)

for pattern, repl, desc in subs:
    apply(pattern, repl, desc)
```

**Why it matters:** Counts drift the moment a skill or article is added; one pass regenerates them, and the script exits non-zero if any expected section fails to match, so drift surfaces instead of shipping silently. Counting only git-tracked skill dirs keeps local leftovers from skewing the result versus CI.

---

### Example: Regenerate Repo READMEs from a Manifest with Python
**Repo:** `ai-thoughts` | **Language:** Python | **Purpose:** Rebuild `README.md` and `README_zh.md` from `articles.yaml`, with a `--check` mode for CI

```python
if args.check:
    ok = True
    for target, generated in ((README_EN, en), (README_ZH, zh)):
        current = target.read_text(encoding="utf-8") if target.exists() else None
        if current != generated:
            ok = False
            print(f"stale: {target.name} is out of date")
    return 0 if ok else 1
```

**Why it matters:** Both language READMEs come from one manifest, so the English and Chinese indexes can't diverge, and `--check` makes CI fail on a stale README rather than letting it drift.

## 💡 Design Philosophy

1. **Skills > Projects** — I think in workflows. Every tool becomes a reusable skill.
2. **Multilingual by default** — English + Chinese (Simplified + Traditional)
3. **Code clarity wins** — Readable Python/JS beats clever one-liners. Always.
4. **Composition over bloat** — Small, focused repos that work well together.
5. **Learn in public** — Detailed articles about what works (and what doesn't).
